    "### What is OCTAVE?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Octave](https://octave.org) is a programming language specifically designed for numerical computation with vectors and matrices. It is a high-level interface to a number of standard numerical libraries such as LAPACK or BLAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Octave's syntax is similar to that of MatLab. In the vast majority of cases (and probably in all numerical computation practices you will do during the Degree), programs written in Octave can be run without any modification in MatLab. Since MatLab is a commercial software, it has a larger number of functions than Octave, as well as specialized packages (*tool-boxes*) not available in Octave, and sometimes of indisputable power.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the functionality required for most of the grade level practices is also available in Octave. On the other hand, Octave is [*free software*](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.es.html), which means not only that it is free, but also that, unlike MatLab, it gives the user the so-called 4 freedoms over the program he uses:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Freedom to use the program, for any purpose.\n",
    " * Freedom of access to the source code of the program.\n",
    " * Freedom to copy and distribute.\n",
    " * Freedom to modify and improve the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a large number of help manuals that will allow the student to progress as much as he wishes in his skills as an Octave/MatLab programmer. As a first approach, the [introductory manual](http://math.jacobs-university.de/oliver/teaching/iub/resources/octave/octave-intro/octave-intro.html) by Hubert Selhofer *et al.* is suggested. In addition, students are provided with an [Octave/Matlab manual](http://meteo.unican.es/work/juaco/G328_intro_Octave.pdf) adapted to the initial requirements for this subject.\n",
    "Finally, a brief guide to start using OCTAVE is included in the project wiki: [Using Octave](https://wiki.octave.org/Using_Octave).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"H_134FF586\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started with OCTAVE\n",
    "\n",
    "The OCTAVE window installed on our computer presents a graphical interface that shows a desktop divided into several parts, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  The commands to be executed are typed in the command window, <samp>Command Window</samp>.\n",
    "-  In the editor (<samp>Editor</samp> window) we write code that we will save in scripts with extension <samp>.m</samp> and execute in the command window.\n",
    "-  The <samp>Workspace</samp> window provides information on the variables used.\n",
    "\n",
    "... although this layout is user-configurable, so it can be presented in a wide variety of forms\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:left\">\n",
    "   <img src=\"../figs/octave_GUI_EN.png\" width=\"750\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are more, the basic data types in OCTAVE for us are the following: real or complex numbers, Booleans (logical values) and character strings (or <samp>strings</samp>). In any case, the basic object of work in OCTAVE are matrices. Scalars and vectors are considered particular cases of matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command window usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions ending with a semicolon do not print the results on the screen. Previous instructions can be recalled by using the up and down arrow keys, or by going to the session history window (it is also possible to save the history and reopen it later, although we generally prefer to use a script and save it before closing so that we can run our program again at a later time).\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"H_D10F85D2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new variable to work with, specify the name you want to give to the variable, followed by the equal sign \"<samp>=\"</samp> (assignment operator) and the value you want to assign to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are certain **rules for defining variables in OCTAVE**:Enter the following command in the command line, and press the `Enter` key to execute the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You cannot create variables without assigning a value to them.\n",
    "- The name of a variable can have a maximum of 63 characters, which can be letters, numbers and the underscore.\n",
    "- The first character must be a letter, `array2` is a valid name, but `2array` is NOT.\n",
    "- Uppercase and lowercase letters have a case-sensitive value. The variable `module` is distinct from the variable `module`.\n",
    "- Inside a variable name there cannot be blank spaces, `modulo1` is a valid variable name, but `modulo 1` is NOT.\n",
    "- There are names that should be avoided because they have their own meaning in OCTAVE (they are _reserved variables_): `ans`, `pi`, `Inf`, `i`, for example... "
